So where my team is sitting, because we have a\", metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content='because we have a broad view across all different applications, we understand together collectively - what are the needs that we have from both the algorithm standpoint, methodology standpoint, from the platform 20 standpoint, to be able to make every data scientist to be more successful.', metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"This allows us to establish that leverage across, but you can say on the other hand, the downside of having a central team is the potential danger of you have this central team think that they are the center of excellence, sit in the corner and not really actually try to figure out what are the problems that we're solving.

The way that I've seen on both sides of the aisle is folks on the application side, they complain about problems - 'Okay, this is not working, is not able to allow me to do X, Y, and\", metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"me to do X, Y, and Z'. They kind of done so that problem over the wall to the platform team and the platform team catch it. That user are just doing exactly what the applications team tell them to do.

So the part that I always liked, I'm going to quote one of those legendary engineering leader, I think, Eldridge that he used to say, 'Do you want to be part of the problem or do you want to be part of the solution?' The thing is that a lot of times, application teams think that it's the platform's job to build the solution, and it's a platform's job to make them successful in using those tools and the capabilities, and the thing is that has to be very\", metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content='that has to be very much handing in.', metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"So let me kind of break it down. You think about there's various different stages as you are building a platform. In day one, as you're building that capability is to have our accountability on both sides. I would always go to my team and say, 'Hey, you know what? It's not just the platform's job to deliver the feature you need. If the feature is delivered and you're like, you know what, that's not the right feature that's going to solve my problem because I have all the problems. I'm not going\", metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"I'm not going to be able to use that platform.' I'd say, 'Hey, you know what? It's as much of your responsibility as much as their responsibility as it is yours, so I'm going to hold both of you accountable to make this successful.' So I think from day one, that just really forces the teams to think about it together as they have the same goal, the same success, that both sides have, and then once this is sort of maybe a only piece built, and you get into this sort of adoption phase. On a lot of\", metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"phase. On a lot of times, the platform team has these challenges as they build something they think is amazing, the most wonderful thing in the world. Then the folks on say, 'I've got something here that kind of worked for me. Why would I want to migrate all my approach to yours?' People just have that intrinsically on waiting list to go move into something new, even though there's a new thing, long-term may be beneficial for them.\", metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content='The way that I also see that worked really well is having this model that I like to call a champion model.', metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"So this example you'll get a platform and that you have to convince 10 other teams to use it. Don't say, 'Hey, all of you guys come and use my thing,' but start with a couple of them who are already leaning in. They're already showed interest. They're already like, 'You know what? I'm actually excited about the same.' So get them on board first 'cause the other customers who are more likely to be telling you what's going wrong and they're not going to abandon you like before just because there\", metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content='just because there is a simple bug that you have in your system. So work with them to address really their need, and also allows your platform resources to be able to focus on making them happy. Once you have good team A fully onboarded and happy using your platform, you go to team B, you go to team C, and once you have four out of the 10 teams onboarded, and they started to demonstrate the value of using your platform, boom! You know what? The rest of the six teams would just pull you on.', metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"So I think, again, in our adoption phase, there is also that sort of approach and that needs to be thinking very carefully as well. I would say then the last phase, we talked about during the building phase, during the adoption phase and then in the mature phase. So let's say you've already got a platform that is running, everybody's using yet, and obviously we all know that you have to be continuously evolving and building on top of there by just creating that holistic culture that the\", metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"culture that the application team, they should demand the platform teams.

You wanted to democratize as much as you can. If you have a platform, a team of 10 that's building this tool, you have 500 people who are using it and think about how you can give those 500 people a chance to contribute to your platform.

Think about there can be use cases where the existing algorithms that we built into the platforms were not enough to detect a particular anomaly. So we asked you again, allow the application teams to then introduce their own algorithms on top of it. So there's always that the platform is focused on the core, but if the platform is architected in a way that allows that stability, then you got all the 500 other people who's\", metadata={'source': 'content/data/453 - Ya Xu.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"other people who's going to be working for free for you to make the platform better versus they decided, 'You know what?

First of all, we don't have a big data set. Our biggest data set is something like, I'm talking about public data set here. Some like ImageNet, which is 1 million images and imagery has been a fantastic data to serve the community for 10 years.

I did one in computer science, another one in information science, because I wanted to understand the technology itself, but I also wanted to understand how technology's impacting people.\", metadata={'source': 'content/data/537 - Yunyao Li.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"So, my information science is more focused on the HCI and the information economics. Then, I pursued my PhD in database. However, it's not a traditional database PhD. What I did was to enable people to [create/query] a database using natural language.

When you try to find the answer to a question, maybe it's only one page that has the answer. Unlike when you do a\", metadata={'source': 'content/data/537 - Yunyao Li.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"Unlike when you do a Google search on the internet, when you search for a certain question, you may have hundreds of pages.

How do we incorporate a more advanced machine learning capability into it?\"', metadata={'source': 'content/data/537 - Yunyao Li.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"So, at a different period of time, we have different focus, but overall, because we have this one bigger project, we can build one thing top the other.

I think maybe I can describe a particular system we have recently built, and I think that this system is kind of representative for all the challenges.\\n\\n[00:15:06] Sam Charrington: Okay.\", metadata={'source': 'content/data/537 - Yunyao Li.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"[00:15:06] Yunyao Li: So, one I've been working on with the Watson Discovery team was to build something called Watson Discovery's Content Intelligence.

First of all, the first step is a lot of contracts are in PDF format. So, we need to convert the PDF into a form consumable by the machine, right? Then secondly, we need to build models to simulate what the non-professionals will do so that we can can help them. So, [what kind of] understanding is involved on how [inaudible]. Given every single document, identify the clause. For simplicity, you can think of sentences. For', metadata={'source': 'content/data/537 - Yunyao Li.txt'}), Document(page_content='of sentences.
